1	doc51	过渡到为人父母的时期是新任父母们面临的最紧张的调适期之一，无论是与个体自我的关系还是与他者的关系。 		The transition to parenthood is one of the most stressful adjustment periods faced by new parents, both in relation to the individual's self and others.	HuaweiTSC_run1				5673363
2	doc51	针对这种过渡时期的代际关系之间的双向关联的研究非常有限，而且相互关系的复杂性也会根据生活居住情境的不同而变化。 		Research on the bidirectional relationship between these transitional intergenerational relationships is very limited, and the complexity of the relationship varies according to life and residence situations.	HuaweiTSC_run1				5673363
3	doc51	本研究旨在探索（1）过渡为家长期间，夫妻婚姻关系和与对方父母的冲突两者之间的双向关联性，以及（2）和父亲同住对上述关系的调适影响作用。 		The aim of this study was to explore (1) the bidirectional relationship between marital relationship and conflict with the other parent during the transition to parenthood, and (2) the moderating effect of living with the father on the relationship.	HuaweiTSC_run1				5673363
4	doc51	本文的研究对象是359名已婚母亲，采用了三波前瞻性长期性研究设计。 		A three-wave prospective long-term study design was used with 359 married mothers.	HuaweiTSC_run1	A <tag>three-wave</tag> prospective long-term study design was used with 359 married mothers.	Terminology - Inconsistent use of terminology	Major	5673363
5	doc51	使用二元调整量表和斯特赖克调整清单量表来评估婚姻关系以及与对方父母的冲突关系。 		The Binary Adjustment Scale and the Stryker Adjustment Inventory scale were used to assess marital relationships and conflicting relationships with the other parent.	HuaweiTSC_run1				5673363
6	doc51	研究相互关系时使用的是交叉时滞平面分析，确定这些关系是否随着生活情境的不同而呈现出不同的模式时使用的是多群组分析。 		Cross-lagged plane analysis was used to study relationships, and multigroup analysis was used to determine whether these relationships showed different patterns with different life situations.	HuaweiTSC_run1				5673363
7	doc51	两个交叉－时滞模型表明，在怀孕中期至后期，婚内问题和与对方父母的冲突之间存在着双向关系。 		Two cross-lagged models suggest a bidirectional relationship between marital problems and conflict with the other parent between the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.	HuaweiTSC_run1				5673363
8	doc51	同时，多群组分析表明，在妊娠期间与父母同住的受试组中，与对方父母的冲突会引发婚内问题；而不与父母同住的受试组中，在怀孕后期到产后期，与对方父亲之间的关系冲突可能强化婚姻问题。 		At the same time, multigroup analysis showed that in the group of participants who lived with their parents during pregnancy, conflict with the other parent led to marital problems, while in the group of participants who did not live with their parents, relationship conflict with the other father may reinforce marital problems from late pregnancy to the postpartum period.	HuaweiTSC_run1				5673363

1	doc52	线性回归模型被广泛应用于精神卫生和卫生服 务相关研究。 		Linear regression models have been widely used in mental health and health service-related studies.	HuaweiTSC_run1				5673363
2	doc52	然而，经典线性回归分析是假设该数据 为正态分布的，但是很多研究所获得的数据并不符合 这种假设。 		However, classical linear regression analysis assumes that the data are normally distributed, but the data obtained in many studies do not meet this assumption.	HuaweiTSC_run1				5673363
3	doc52	解决该问题的方法之一是采用不要求数据 为正态分布的半参数模型。 		One way to solve this problem is to use a semiparametric model that does not require the data to be normally distributed.	HuaweiTSC_run1				5673363
4	doc52	但是，半参数模型对离散 数据相当敏感，因此在处理包含离散值的数据时产生 的估计值是不可靠的。 		However, semiparametric models are quite sensitive to discrete data and therefore produce unreliable estimates when handling data containing discrete values.	HuaweiTSC_run1				5673363
5	doc52	在这种情况下，一些研究者在 删减这些极端值后再进行分析，但是，删减数据的事 先法则（ad-hoc rules）是基于主观标准的，所以不同 的调整方法就会产生不同的结果。 		In this case, some researchers censored these extreme values before analyzing them, but the ad-hoc rules for censoring data are based on subjective criteria, so different adjustment methods will produce different results.	HuaweiTSC_run1				5673363
6	doc52	等级回归为处理包 括离散值的非正态分布数据提供了更为客观的方法。 		Hierarchical regression provides a more objective method for processing non-normally distributed data containing discrete values.	HuaweiTSC_run1				5673363
